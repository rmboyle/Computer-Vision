p1.cpp

	The masks that were used were the 3X3 Sobel mask in the X and the Y direction. This gave better results than the regular image gradient initially used.

p2.cpp
	
	The ranges possible for theta are from -Pi/2 to Pi/2 and possible rho values are from 0 to the length of the diagonal of the image.

	Resolution chosen 800x800 gave reasonable result and easy to see what was happening in the image.

	The voting scheme was chosen that if for all theta values a point x y converted to rho increased the acumluator array based on an 800x800 scale.

	The edge threshold was 60.
p3.cpp

	hough_simple_1.pgm threshold: 255
	hough_simple_2.pgm threshold: 175
	hough_complex.pgm threshold: 200

p4.cpp

	The algorithm to find line segments takes the hough image and uses the thresholded image. It looks for a local maxima in the hough image and then draws points following a line by looking at the thresholded image. It does not draw the points if there isnt a pixel in the thresholded image along the hough transform line.
