Status: COMPLETE

p1.cpp
	Creates a binary image based on a threshold. The value used for the threshold: 110

p2.cpp
	Labels the image using the connected component algorithm and union find data structure to find the equivalent labels.

p3.cpp
	Adds a center dot to the image and a line representing the orientation.
	Creates a database with each objects characteristics:
	LABEL x y AREA ORIENTATION eMIN ROUNDNESS 	

p4.cpp
	Finds the image attributes same from p3.cpp. Compares the database and the image object attributes. 

	CRITERIA: Must be within Roundness, Area, and eMin threshold.
	Thresholds: 	Roundness: .1
		    	Area: 250
		    	eMin: 490000
